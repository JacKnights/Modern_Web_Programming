# README

## 代码完成的一些事情
* `pie.html` 完成了要求里面列出的全部额外功能。
* `index.html`完成了一个首页，主要是根据作业要求里面的“Granny's Pies”公司而做完成的，内容也是和公司的其他pie或者甜品来设定的。
* 由于Firefox浏览器的一些不同，所以会与效果图有些出入（主要体现在textarea的体现上），效果图由Chrome截图取得。建议使用Chrome打开。

## 文件的组织
仓库名称是**Granny_Pies**，里面分为**index.html**,**pie.html**,**README.md**,**js**,**css**和**images**。其中**images**文件夹里面包含了一些两个网页所用到的图片。**css**则是有两个网页的层叠样式表。**js**文件夹包含了一些很简单的JavaScript代码实现与用户的一些简单的交互。**README.md**则如您所见是对整个文件夹及其内容等等的说明补充。`文件引用的图片均来自无版权网站，引用的网页分别为维基百科英文版和百度百科中文版的栏目。`

## 网页的特别之处
1. 完成了列出的所有附加功能。
2. 一些必要的地方增加了注释。
3. 有缩进，不必要的时候不用class或者id等东西来写样式。
4. 两个网页间是有联系的，且联系并没有很突兀的感觉。
5. 虽然用到了一些JavaScript语句，但是整个页面效果不是很酷炫，但是在我看来还是比较友好的，做的时候着重在内容和谐与页面友好。（可能做得还是不太好）

### English Version:

# What I have done in the source codes
* `pie.html` has already finished the extra effect.
* According to the request, `index.html` introduces the current activity and other pie recipes of Granny's Pies.

## The organizations of the files
Repository's name is  **Granny_Pies**. In the repository is the **index.html**,**pie.html**,**css**,**js**,**images** and **README.md**. In the folder **images**, there is picture that is used in the two web pages.**css** includes css to be used in the pages. Codes in **js** is to finish some simple iteraction with users. Evident in this file, **README.md** says something to explain the whole repository.`The photo I added by myself was collected in a free website. The links are from wikipedia, English version and Baidu, Chinese version.`

##  Special things in my files
1. all extra effect is included.
2. I add some comments when I think it is necessary.
3. .html and .css files has indentation, and class or id was not used if unnecessary.
4. Something contacts two web pages.
5. I think that such two web pages are not difficult to finish. That's why I thought to add something great in those before. Finally, I think it is not important to how difficult to finish the pages but the appearance of the pages. I was "educated" to do before because the pages I wrote at some times were difficult to finish but the pages are ugly. Hahaha... However, because of many reasons, I use some JavaScript to finish the work. But I still insist that our tech is served for the prototype, not our tech itself.
