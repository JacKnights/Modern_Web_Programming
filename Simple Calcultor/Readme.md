## Update
1. calculator finished generally.
2. 11.09 9:31 ban octal and perfect illegal input.
3. 11.09 13:04 octal can be used again. What's more, after alert error, the input will be cleared.
4. 11.09 18:33 perfect my calculator like using readonly instead of javascript to preventing sending anything through keyborad. However, I can't accept such comments for I think it doesn't respect my design.
